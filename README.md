# tictactoe-minimax

Project Description
This project implements the Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the optimal moves for the 'X' player. The implementation includes functions to check for a winner, determine a draw, and calculate the best move using the Minimax algorithm enhanced with alpha-beta pruning for improved efficiency.

Features
- Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implementation: A classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- Minimax Algorithm: A recursive algorithm to determine the optimal move for the 'X' player.
- Alpha-Beta Pruning: Enhances the Minimax algorithm by pruning branches that cannot affect the final decision, improving computational efficiency.
- Winner and Draw Detection: Functions to check for winning conditions and draw states.

Code Overview
Functions
- is_winner(board, player): Checks if the specified player ('X' or 'O') has won the game.
- is_draw(board): Checks if the game has reached a draw state.
- minimax(board, depth, is_maximizing, alpha, beta): Implements the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
- best_move(board): Determines the best move for the 'X' player.
